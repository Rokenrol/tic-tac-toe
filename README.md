# tic-tac-toe

The goal of this project was to build a Tic-tac-toe game with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We had to build a working game in console first and then build a UI to display it. The main goal was to have as little global code as possible and tuck everything inside factory functions.

This project was a hard one for me but after a lot of struggle I managed to do it in the end.
